# signup-signin_dashboard
This is a app where users can register with username password 
Already registered users can login.
I have used token based registration.
when user login they will be directed to dashboard page where there are many subparts where they can update ,delete their information.
After that in dashboard page there is a logout page which will eventually lead them to login page.

Made using React.js as frontend framework and Django RESTAPI as backend and Bootstrap for designing.
